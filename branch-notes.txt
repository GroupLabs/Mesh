tinygrad

1. Define appropriate operations with NEON/Accelerate 

Need to implement the following operations:

Buffer                                                       # class of memory on this device
https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml/blob/master/include/ggml/ggml.h

The buffer is the tensor struct.














unary_op  (NOOP, EXP, LOG, CAST)                             # A -> A
reduce_op (SUM, MAX)                                         # A -> B (smaller size, B has 1 in shape)
binary_op (ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, POW, CMPEQ, MAX)              # A + A -> A (all the same size)
movement_op (EXPAND, RESHAPE, PERMUTE, PAD, SHRINK, STRIDE)  # A -> B (different size)
fused_op [[optional]] (MULACC)                               # A * A -> B

2. Python bindings
3. Apply bindings to tinygrad

Bind in the same form as:
