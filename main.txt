The following is a scenario for how Mesh will be used. The following is low-level psuedo code, but we can iteratively move up
to something like Python down the road.

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10]

b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10]

mesh = Mesh() // initiate Mesh context, automatically 

print(mesh.devices()) // get available devices

product = mesh.multiply(a, b) // array multiplication

tensor = mesh.multiply(product, product) // matrix multiplication

sum = mesh.add(tensor, tensor) // tensor addition
